Parker - For HW11 we still have not completed the final 2 maze of Lab11 so we decided to try and make a script that could pass those mazes. The script solve-maze is a script
that was able to pass both mazes with enough time to complete. Solve-maze2 and solve-maze3 would get confused when presented with an open area and not just a narrow way.
